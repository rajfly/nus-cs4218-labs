The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Every good boy deserves fruit.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
A wizard's job is to vex chumps quickly in fog.
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.
Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim.
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
